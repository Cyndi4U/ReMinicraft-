# ReMinicraft+
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37089149/153483527-16dbda7d-5a11-4b93-b267-14564a7bfc58.png)
A Minicraft+ Texture Pack with the intention of keeping Minicraft's style but slightly enhancing it and increasing it's consistency, with a couple inspirations and ideas taken from the Ulracraft texture pack was well.

The biggest changes are with the entities, with Items being next, and the Tiles and GUI being change in the least visible way. However, they all have little changes to them to make them, in my opinion, a little bit better.

To install this texture pack, go to %appdata%\playminicraft\mods\Minicraft_Plus\TexturePacks and place the zip file in there. Then, to activate it within the game, in the Main Menu (*not* in-game) go to Options>Texture Packs>ReMinicraft+.zip

I've also created a skin for you to use that matches the rest of the entities in ReMinicraft+ that I've delicately named "Paulveralls," as well as a version with a cape. To install this skin in 2.1.0, go to %appdata%\playminicraft\mods\Minicraft_Plus\skins and place the Paulveralls.png (or Caped Paulveralls.png) file from the ReMinicraft+ archive. To activate it within game, in the Main Menu go to Skins>Paulveralls. I don't mind if you use or edit this skin for personal use.
